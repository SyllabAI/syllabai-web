/**
 * Learner overlay derivation — KG phase 1 (derivation), extended in phase 2.
 *
 * The v77 renderer ships a dormant learner-state engine: GRAPH_CONTRACT v1.0
 * declares a per-spec-point `learnerOverlay` (mastery / confidence / fluency /
 * evidence / reviewDue / misconception), and the student lens already paints
 * mastery bands (55/70/80), review flags and a full next-best-action scorer
 * off it. The engine was fed nothing — an embedded OpenHuman *sample* map lit
 * up whatever point codes happened to collide, which is neither honest nor
 * course-aware.
 *
 * This module feeds the engine from the demo's only learner evidence source:
 * the browser-local progress overlay (lib/progress.ts — SIMULATED by design,
 * never written to canonical content). Derivation follows the honesty rules
 * the web workbench pins for its measured-fact surfaces:
 *
 *   - mastery comes from MARKED attempts only (self-scores and MCQ marks,
 *     marks-weighted). Reading notes or rating flashcards is self-report —
 *     it never produces a mastery number.
 *   - no evidence at all → mastery null → the renderer shows its own
 *     "Not measured" state (gray ring, no band). Nothing is invented.
 *   - notes read / flashcards rated contribute to `evidence` (exposure —
 *     the renderer's thin-evidence heuristic), not to mastery.
 *   - `reviewDue` is the forgetting-decay model (lib/forgetting.ts): a point
 *     is due when its Ebbinghaus-decayed effective mastery crosses the band
 *     threshold above where it was demonstrated (τ = 30/90/365 days — demo
 *     parameters, same shape as the web workbench's nightly job).
 *   - `misconception` (KG phase 3) comes from the content bridge: the course's
 *     misconception corpus (SME/mark-scheme provenance) supplies content and
 *     spec-point mapping, the seeded sim learner supplies state (probability /
 *     active / evidenceCount — SIMULATED, deterministic). Active states ride
 *     the overlay as the renderer's misconception signal; they NEVER invent
 *     mastery — points without marked attempts stay "Not measured".
 *   - confidence / fluency stay null (attempt-slider telemetry is a later
 *     phase).
 *
 * The result is pushed into the iframe over postMessage (`syllabai-kg:learner`)
 * by the knowledge-graph host; the renderer gates its embedded sample off the
 * moment a live overlay arrives. Phase 2 layers the My State / History drawer
 * on top of the same derivation (lib/kg-learner-state.ts) — this module keeps
 * the shared pieces: the content bridge, the per-point accumulators and the
 * overlay build itself.
